# independent-projects

Here I am including files of my projects that I am making while learning. I am new at app development and trying to develop my skill. I will give short description of my projects.

#Tic-Tac-Toe

It is my first swift project from scratch. It is not sufficient but I tried using protocol and structures to build this game. I used slider, text field, buttons, labels, imageviews. I included some gaming functions to make it more fun.
