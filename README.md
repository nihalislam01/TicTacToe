# tictactoe-repo

It is a basic tic tac toe game. I made three seperate screens and view controller. 
One is the main sceen with only two buttons (start, quit). Second one is to set name and game point. 
Third screen is for the game. The game can be played as many time as we want using the "play again" button which appears after someone won.
