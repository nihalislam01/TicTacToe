# TicTacToeGame

It is my first swift project from scratch. It is not sufficient but I tried using protocol and structures to build this game. I used slider, text field, buttons, labels, imageviews. I included some gaming functions to make it more fun. I am a bit laggy about UI design and constrains. As a result, this app only works in iPhone 14 Pro max.
